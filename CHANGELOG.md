# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-dev-team. Versions follow semver.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-06-15
### Security / hardening (full agent-system audit)
- **Least-privilege tools** — the 7 builders (`backend/frontend/mobile/data/devops/qa/diagrams`) now
  declare an explicit `tools:` allowlist (`Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit`) instead of inheriting
  **all tools**. They can no longer spawn subagents (`Task`/`Agent` → cost runaway), `WebFetch`, or
  `NotebookEdit` — only the orchestrator fans out.
- **Anti-hallucination block** added to the 7 agents that lacked it (5 Bug Council + `ui-ux-engineer` +
  `security-reviewer`): ground every claim in real files/output, never fake "done/passing".
- **No same-file collisions** — the contract rule now forbids two agents on the same *file* in one wave
  (e.g. `technical-writer` + `diagrams` on one `.md` run sequentially).
- `ui-ux-engineer` Wave 2 review is now **strictly read-only** (writes only during Wave 0 design).
- `security-reviewer` gains **context7 + WebFetch** to verify CVEs / library security during review.
- `qa-engineer` notes that hard diagnosis warrants Opus / the Bug Council.

## [1.17.1] — 2026-06-15
### Docs
- **README installation overhaul** — a guide-style, production-grade flow: **Step 1 (install, all
  platforms) → Step 2 (per-OS setup) → verify with `/cdt:doctor`**. Separate, collapsible step-by-step
  guides for **macOS / Windows / Linux** (Windows covers Git Bash + the WSL `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH`
  pin + the status line). Fixed the cross-links. Written via the new technical-writing discipline.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **`technical-writer` agent + `technical-writing` skill** — a docs specialist for user-facing
  documentation (README, guides, **release notes**, **CHANGELOG**, **ADRs**, **PR descriptions**). Owns
  `docs/*` prose (not diagram blocks); grounds every claim in real code/output; keeps docs↔reality in
  sync. Wired into Wave 1 (parallel, for user-facing changes) + SKILL routing. Roster is now **14 core
  agents**; **8 quality skills**. (Closes the 'writer' gap vs. the reference architecture; media/video
  intentionally skipped as off-mission.)

## [1.16.0] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Notifications now report the cost of *that task*, not cumulative budget.** The Discord/Telegram
  message shows **tokens used to deliver this task** (an input+output **delta**) and **how long it took**
  — instead of the running session/weekly %. The orchestrator captures a `cdt-tokens` baseline at task
  start and passes the `--tokens`/`--duration` deltas at delivery.
### Added
- **`cdt-tokens`** — prints today's running input+output token total from local transcripts, so a
  per-task cost can be measured as a delta. Pure python3 stdlib.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Plugin renamed to `cdt`** — slash commands are now **`/cdt:*`** (e.g. `/cdt:ship`, `/cdt:doctor`,
  `/cdt:autopilot`) instead of `/claude-dev-team:*`, matching the `cdt-*` CLIs. The marketplace / repo /
  brand stays **claude-dev-team**; install with `claude plugin install cdt@claude-dev-team`. Existing
  installs should reinstall under the new id (`claude plugin uninstall claude-dev-team` → install `cdt`).

## [1.14.0] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Notifications are now rich + detailed.** Discord uses a **colored embed** (green delivered / red
  blocker / …) and Telegram a **formatted HTML** message — each with the **task**, **tier**, **duration**,
  **Task-Loop iterations**, and your current **Max usage %** (session/weekly), plus a timestamp.
  `cdt-notify` gained optional flags (`--task --tier --duration --iters --tokens`); bare
  `cdt-notify TYPE "msg"` still works. The orchestrator fills the fields in automatically. Secrets still
  go to curl via a stdin config; all fields are JSON/HTML-escaped (injection-safe).

## [1.13.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Two new role agents (Opus)** — completing a product → design → build → review chain:
  - **`product-manager`** (Wave 0, read-only) — turns a vague/user-facing ask into **requirements +
    testable acceptance criteria + scope/non-goals**; its criteria feed the qa tests and the review's
    scope check. Pairs with `superpowers:brainstorming`.
  - **`ui-ux-engineer`** (Wave 0 design + Wave 2 review) — UX flows, **design system/tokens**, and an
    **accessibility (a11y) + visual-polish review**. Owns `design/*`; auto-applies `ui-ux-pro-max` +
    `web-design-guidelines`; the frontend/mobile engineer implements.
  Roster is now **13 core agents** (+ 5 Bug Council). Wired into the Wave 0/Wave 2 flow, SKILL routing,
  the Opus tier, and the team table/diagram. (Memory stays infrastructure; product ownership stays human.)

## [1.12.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu-bar **Eco mode** submenu now labels the default option **"Off (default)"** — uniform with the
  Effort ("Xhigh (default)") and Model ("Opus 4.8 (default)") submenus.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Interactive menu-bar controls.** The macOS menu bar dropdown is now a control panel, not just a
  display: an **Enabled** toggle (enable/disable CDT) plus **Eco mode**, **Effort**, and **Model**
  submenus (current value checkmarked). Each selection runs `cdt-config` and the menu refreshes in place.
  effort/model apply next session, as before.
### Changed
- **Eco mode now defaults to `off`** (was `auto`) — full quality by default; opt in with
  `cdt-config eco on|auto`. Keeps Opus/quality the default and only conserves when you choose to.

## [1.11.4] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Worked e2e example** in `demo/login-rate-limit/`: a stdlib HTTP API (`api/server.py`, `POST /login`)
  + **6 real end-to-end tests** (`tests/test_e2e.py`) that boot the server on a free port and drive the
  full journey with live `urllib` requests (200 login · 401 wrong/unknown · 429 lockout · 429-while-locked).
  Produced by the orchestrator (backend ∥ qa in parallel; security review PASS). The demo suite is now
  **26 tests** and the e2e runs in CI — a concrete demonstration of the e2e quality gate (v1.11.3).

## [1.11.3] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **e2e is now a first-class quality gate.** The qa-engineer's playbook and the orchestration gate chain
  (now **10 gates**, e2e at #6) require **end-to-end tests for user-facing changes** — the real user
  journey via Playwright/Cypress (web), Detox/Maestro (mobile), or supertest/HTTP-flow (APIs), using
  context7 for the framework API and kept deterministic. If a project has no e2e harness, the orchestrator
  proposes one; if e2e can't run, it says so — **never fakes an e2e pass**. (Distinct from `scripts/e2e.sh`,
  which tests this plugin itself.)

## [1.11.2] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Committed end-to-end test (`scripts/e2e.sh`) + CI gates.** The e2e runs in a **sandbox** (a throwaway
  temp HOME — never touches your real `~/.claude`) and asserts the full chain: SessionStart bootstrap →
  doctor → deps → learn→recall → task→stats → statusline→budget(eco) → config on/off → notify→log. CI now
  runs **three gates** on every push/PR: `validate.sh`, the demo unit tests, and `e2e.sh`. Documented in
  the README ("How to review / audit") and CONTRIBUTING.

## [1.11.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Documentation:** a single, complete **Requirements** section — a per-OS table of every system tool
  (required vs optional), the "no pip packages — python3 stdlib only" note, and the auto-installed
  companion plugins. Added to the table of contents.
- **Eco mode works on macOS out of the box:** the menu bar app now caches each usage fetch to
  `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`, so `cdt-budget`/Eco have fresh data without the status line (Windows/Linux
  still use the status line). Verified end-to-end on macOS.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Prerequisite installer (`cdt-deps` + `/cdt:deps`)** — checks the system tools CDT uses
  (python3, git, curl, sqlite3, gh) and, with `--install`, installs the missing ones via the detected
  package manager (brew / apt / dnf / pacman / zypper / winget / choco / scoop). Companion **plugins**
  already auto-install via the manifest; scripts use **python3 stdlib only** (no pip packages). First
  session prints a one-line nudge if python3 is missing; `/doctor` points here.
### Changed
- **Cross-platform analytics** — `db.sh` and `cdt-stats` now fall back to **python3's built-in sqlite3**
  when the `sqlite3` CLI is absent (common on Windows), so state logging / stats work everywhere python3
  is present. Independent portability audit across all hooks: **PORTABLE** on macOS / Linux / Windows
  (Git Bash) — every macOS command guarded, `date` has a GNU fallback, all bash-3.2 safe.

## [1.10.1] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Windows support** — the orchestration layer (agents, skills, commands, `cdt-*` CLIs, hooks, vault,
  analytics) now runs on Windows. Added `.gitattributes` to **force LF** on shell scripts (CRLF would
  break the bash shebang on Windows checkouts) and a **Windows & Linux** setup section (Git for Windows +
  Python 3; pin `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` if WSL is present; run `/doctor` to verify). The macOS-only
  **menu bar** is skipped on Windows/Linux — use the cross-platform **status line** instead.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Budget-aware Eco mode** (`cdt-budget` + `cdt-config eco`) — before a T2+ dispatch the orchestrator
  checks your real weekly usage; when high it **conserves** (prefers Sonnet, smallest safe tier, skips
  optional agents) and says why. Never weakens the risk floor / security review, never uses Haiku for
  real work. Default `auto`.
- **Status line** (`cdt-statusline` + `cdt-config statusline on`) — a terminal status line
  (`CDT on · Opus · xhigh · 41% wk`) that works **cross-platform** (Linux/Windows, no menu bar needed) and
  caches your usage % so Eco mode can read it.
- **`/cdt:doctor`** (`cdt-doctor`) — one-command install health check (hooks, CLIs, DB, gh,
  notifier, menu bar, companion deps) with a fix hint for anything not green.
- **`cdt-learn "<lesson>"`** + `/cdt:learn` — teach the vault a durable lesson on demand
  (surfaced later by `cdt-recall`).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **`cdt-config` + `/cdt:config`** — a control surface to **enable/disable** the whole
  orchestration layer and set its **defaults (effort, model)**. `off` makes the next session behave as
  stock Claude Code (the SessionStart hook stops injecting the protocol). `effort`/`model` are written to
  `~/.claude/settings.json` as a **safe merge** (all other settings preserved) and apply next session.
  Defaults are **xhigh effort + Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8`); `max` effort is correctly refused
  (session-only). The menu bar dropdown now shows the current mode (`on · xhigh · opus-4-8`).

## [1.8.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Model-routing guardrail hardened** — made explicit everywhere that **Opus is the recommended main
  model**, and that the **low (Haiku) tier is never used for complicated or quality-sensitive work**.
  Strengthened the `fast-ops` agent and the orchestration skill to escalate on anything complicated or
  quality-sensitive (not just "needs judgment"); updated the README routing note to lead with Opus-as-main.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **PR autopilot (`/cdt:autopilot <PR#>`)** — roadmap **Phase 1**. Drives a real GitHub PR
  toward green: read CI → diagnose → focused fix → push to the branch → re-check (capped by
  `CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS`), resolve merge conflicts on the branch, and post a `code-reviewer` +
  `security-reviewer` synthesis as a PR comment. Backed by `cdt-pr`, a read-mostly `gh` wrapper whose
  only state change is posting a comment.
- **Safe by design:** **dry-run by default** (`--live` to act); **never** force-pushes, auto-merges, or
  closes — merging stays the user's explicit call; security review is mandatory before the "ready"
  verdict; reports each milestone via `cdt-notify`. Requires `gh` authenticated.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Adaptive routing (`cdt-advise`)** — roadmap **Phase 3**. Matches a new task against past `tasks`
  history and returns an **advisory** tier/iteration prior (typical tier, iteration budget, blocker
  rate). The orchestration skill consults it on T2+ but still decides — transparent and overridable,
  never a hidden policy. New `/cdt:advise` command. Pure stdlib (python3's built-in
  `sqlite3`), no new dependencies. Adapted from `ruflo`'s trajectory-learning idea, kept on-ethos.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Haiku tier (`fast-ops` agent)** — a cheap, fast "hands" tier for **trivial, mechanical,
  fully-specified** operations only (gather/grep/count, literal find-replace, rename, typo, whitespace,
  template fill). **Hard-guarded:** it is never routed orchestration, architecture, development, testing,
  review, security, or debugging — and it escalates the instant a task needs judgment, so the cheap tier
  can't touch quality-critical work. Model routing is now an explicit 3-tier strategy
  (Opus = judgment · Sonnet = throughput/testing · Haiku = trivial ops). Adapted from the tiered-routing
  idea in public agent catalogs, kept on-ethos.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Targeted memory recall (`cdt-recall`)** — roadmap **Phase 2, first cut**. Instead of dumping the
  whole learnings file, the orchestrator retrieves only the lessons relevant to the current task via a
  lexically-ranked recall (pure stdlib — **no embedding model or network**). New `/cdt:recall`
  command; the orchestration skill now recalls relevant memory on T2+; the SessionStart hook injects only
  the most recent lessons + a recall pointer. Net effect: **context stays lean and sharp as the vault
  grows** (cost-effective memory that scales).

## [1.5.3] — 2026-06-15
### Docs
- Added **`docs/roadmap.md`** — the phased plan toward a *learning agent network* (autonomous Git/CI/PR
  loop, semantic/RAG memory, adaptive routing, opt-in bounded swarms, federation research), with explicit
  fit/risk/cost notes per phase and the principles that constrain it. Linked from the README.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-06-15
### Docs
- **README polish pass** — added a Table of Contents, a **Troubleshooting** table, a **Security &
  privacy** section, and a dedicated **Uninstall** section; added a PRs-welcome badge.
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — hooks table now includes the `SubagentStop` (`agent-track.sh`) hook and
  the macOS menu-bar auto-install.
- Added **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** and GitHub **issue / PR templates** (`.github/`).

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **`db.sh`** flattens newlines/tabs to spaces in stored values (cleaner rows, no smearing); single-quote
  escaping kept, backslashes left intact (SQLite `'…'` literals don't process them).
- **`pkill -f`** in the menu-bar installer now matches the app path literally (dots escaped), so it can't
  over-match an unrelated process.
- **Keychain error** now surfaces the `OSStatus` (via `SecCopyErrorMessageString`), distinguishing a real
  Keychain failure from "not logged in".
- **`RELEASING.md`** documents that the release version comes from `plugin.json`.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-15
Production-grade hardening pass (full T3 audit: security, devops, content, native, distribution).
### Security
- **Notifier input validation** — `cdt-setup` now strictly validates every pasted secret
  (Discord webhook / Telegram token / chat id) with whole-string anchoring + a control-char/newline
  reject, closing a shell-injection vector (the env file is `source`d, so a crafted value could have
  executed code on session start).
- **Secrets out of `argv`** — Discord/Telegram URLs are passed to `curl` via a stdin config (`-K -`),
  so tokens are no longer visible in the process list (`ps`/`/proc`).
### Fixed
- **Menu-bar auto-install churn** — guarded on a real success marker instead of a legacy plist that the
  SMAppService path never creates, so the app is no longer killed/relaunched on every session/clear/compact.
- **Retain cycle** in the menu bar's subscription poller (`[weak self]` on the refresh task).
- **CI no longer rots to a green no-op** — installs `shellcheck` + pinned Python explicitly, and
  `validate.sh` now fails (not skips) when `shellcheck` is missing under CI.
- **Docs↔reality** — README project layout lists the `menubar` command; prerequisite bumped to
  Claude Code ≥ 2.1.143 (dependency auto-enable); `menubar` command hint includes `restart`.

## [1.4.8] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- Agent-run labels no longer truncate to `claude-dev-team:ba` — the menu bar and `cdt-stats` now strip
  the `claude-dev-team:` namespace prefix and show the bare role (`backend-engineer`, `qa-engineer`, …).

## [1.4.7] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- Menu bar dropdown's **claude-dev-team (7d)** panel now shows **sessions logged** (your chats), so the
  section reflects real activity — not just the rarer specialist-subagent dispatches.
### Changed
- README: menu-bar section + screenshot updated for the stacked **CDT** layout (session % over weekly %).
### Fixed
- No more stray **`unknown`** agent row — the `SubagentStop` hook skips runs with no identifiable agent
  type, **and** the menu bar filters `unknown`/empty rows out at query time, so it never displays even
  if an older in-session hook logged one.

## [1.4.6] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar keeps the **CDT** label, with the stacked session %/weekly % beside it (CDT left, percentages
  stacked right) — branded but still narrow.

## [1.4.5] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar shows the two percentages **stacked** (session % over weekly %, color-coded) as a compact
  rendered image — only as wide as "48%" — so it survives a crowded/notched menu bar. Labels stay in the dropdown.

## [1.4.4] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar strip is now compact (**"CDT 20% 48%"** — session then weekly, color-coded) so it no longer
  crowds out other menu bar items on narrow/notched displays. Session/Weekly labels remain in the dropdown.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- App icon: **CDT Usage.app** now uses the Claude Dev Team logo (`menubar/AppIcon.icns`). README shows the
  logo + a screenshot of the menu bar dropdown. The menu bar itself stays the "CDT <session%> <weekly%>" text.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- The menu bar app installs to **/Applications** (was ~/Applications, which isn't where users look),
  falling back to ~/Applications only when /Applications isn't writable. Override with `CDT_MENUBAR_APPS`.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Plugin auto-install now builds **CDT Usage.app into ~/Applications** (a real, signed app) instead of a
  bare background binary, and registers login via **SMAppService** so macOS Login Items / Background
  Activity shows **"CDT Usage"** (not the signing team name).
- Menu bar: long resets (weekly) show an absolute time (e.g. **"Fri 1:59 AM"**); short ones stay a
  countdown ("in 3h 18m").
### Fixed
- Agent activity no longer logs **"unknown"** runs (tries agent_type/subagent_type/agent_name, else skips).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Notarized-DMG release pipeline** for the menu bar app (`menubar/release.sh` + `Info.plist` +
  `RELEASING.md`). Builds a signed `CDT Usage.app`, notarizes + staples it, and packages a drag-to-
  Applications DMG that opens on any Mac with no Gatekeeper warnings. `--bundle-only` tests the `.app`
  locally with any cert. Requires a Developer ID Application cert + notarytool credentials (Team ID
  XCANJ7SYKG).

## [1.3.4] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Code signing.** The menu bar build signs the app with an available identity (Developer ID > Apple
  Development; override via `CDT_SIGN_IDENTITY`). A stable signature makes the macOS Keychain "Always
  Allow" persist across rebuilds (no re-prompt). Builds unsigned — still works locally — if no cert.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **HTTP 429 from the usage endpoint.** Polling was every 60s (too aggressive for the undocumented
  endpoint). Now: subscription %s poll every **5 min** with a **15-min backoff on 429**; local token
  usage still refreshes every 60s. The last good subscription reading stays visible if a refresh fails.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar strip now shows **`CDT <session%> Session  <weekly%> Weekly`** — percentages prominent +
  color-coded, with the `Session`/`Weekly` labels in a small font.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar now shows **`CDT <session%> <weekly%>`** (each % color-coded), instead of a single worst-%.
- Dropdown "updated" time uses **12-hour** format.
- The menu bar app **auto-installs on macOS** on the first session after install (build + launch + login
  auto-start); opt out with `CDT_MENUBAR_AUTO=0`. `cdt-menubar uninstall` is now sticky.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **macOS menu bar usage monitor** (native Swift, in `menubar/`). Shows your real Claude Max
  subscription usage (session %, weekly %, Sonnet %, reset countdowns — from the `oauth/usage`
  endpoint) **plus** accurate local token usage by model and dev-team activity. `/cdt:menubar`
  builds it, enables auto-start (LaunchAgent), and launches it; `cdt-menubar status` is a no-GUI readout.
  Fail-soft: if the (undocumented) subscription endpoint is unavailable, local data still shows.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Analytics framing: "cost" means **token / rate-limit budget** (Claude subscription session + weekly
  limits), **not money** — `/stats` and the orchestrator wording corrected to match Max.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Accurate analytics.** A `SubagentStop` hook records every agent dispatch by real `agent_type`, so
  `/stats` shows a true agent-run breakdown. A `cdt-task` CLI logs tier + Task Loop iterations at ship
  (the orchestrator calls it in the completion mandate) → tier mix + average iterations in `/stats`.
### Changed
- `/stats` no longer prints a fabricated cost estimate. Billing defers to Claude Code's live `/cost`
  (on Max, marginal token cost is ~$0); `cdt-stats` reports **activity**, accurately, not billing.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **`cdt-setup --test` now actually sends.** `cdt-notify` was re-sourcing the env file *after* an
  explicit `CDT_NOTIFY_LEVEL=all` override, resetting it to `milestones` (which filters `INFO`), so the
  test was silently dropped. Overrides are now preserved.
### Changed
- `cdt-setup --discord` / `--telegram` are **additive**: configuring a second channel auto-sets
  `provider=both` instead of overwriting the first.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- Docs now use the correct **namespaced** slash commands (`/cdt:notify-setup`, etc.) — the
  bare `/notify-setup` form does not resolve.
### Changed
- README Notifications rewritten: leads with the fastest path (`!cdt-setup` wizard), step-by-step Discord
  and Telegram with the right commands.
- `notify-setup` command supports Telegram **token-only** (chat id auto-detected).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- `cdt-setup` **auto-detects your Telegram chat id** from the bot token (via `getUpdates`) — no manual
  chat-id lookup. Works in both flag mode (`--telegram <token>`) and the interactive wizard.
### Changed
- README: **step-by-step** Discord and Telegram notification setup.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-15
First production release.
### Added
- **Skill routing** — the orchestrator auto-applies the right quality skill per work-type
  (Web/UI → `ui-ux-pro-max` + `web-design-guidelines`, TS → `clean-code-typescript`,
  debugging → `root-cause-analysis`, simplify → `karpathy-guidelines`, etc.) with no manual invocation.
- **Repo CI** (GitHub Actions) + `scripts/validate.sh`: validates JSON manifests, agent/skill/command
  frontmatter, and shell scripts on every push/PR.
- `CHANGELOG.md`.
### Changed
- `frontend-engineer` and `mobile-engineer` now explicitly auto-apply the UI quality skills.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Auto-install companions** — `superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, `context7` are declared
  as cross-marketplace dependencies and install automatically with claude-dev-team
  (requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.110 and the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- Grant `context7` access to the read-only `architect` and `pattern-matcher` agents.
- Seed a default notify level so `cdt-setup --show` is never blank.
### Changed
- Flatten the Bug Council agents into `agents/` so all 15 agents register.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-15
- Initial release: tech-lead orchestrator, tiered triage, contracts, 10 core + 5 Bug Council agents,
  7 quality skills + orchestration brain, quality gates, Task Loop, completion mandate, SQLite cost
  analytics, Discord/Telegram notifications, and a markdown vault.
